Some people might be looking for Mikey-Sakke by name. Mikey is primarily just the transport mechanism.

For code that does ECCSI sign/ verify (RFC 6507) and SAKKE encrypt/ decrypt (RFC 6508 and parts of 6509), refer to:

For KMS (Key Management Server) code, that generates Mikey-Sakke Key Material that clients can use, refer to:
